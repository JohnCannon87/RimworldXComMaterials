[h2]XCom Materials[/h2]
This mod adds some materials from the games XCom: UFO Defense and XCom: Terror from the Deep, it's mainly to be used with my ship design mods linked below.

[XCom Gravships](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3577855868)
[TFTD Gravships]()



[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]Alien Alloys - Slightly worse than Plasteel, purple colour, can be "Smelted" at an Electric Smelter for the cost of 50 Stone Blocks to get 40 Alien Alloys (mimicing in the OG game how you can just build them)
[*]Aqua Plastics - Again slightly worse than Plasteel, but way better cold insulation and does good amount of blunt damage , can be "Smelted" at an Electric Smelter for the cost of 50 Stone Blocks to get 40 Aqua Plastics (mimicing in the OG game how you can just build them)
[*]Elerium-115 - Rare item that can be found from exotic traders or quest rewards, only useful to build the Sectoid Thrusters from the [XCom Gravships](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3577855868) mod
[*]Zrbite - Rare item that can be found from exotic traders or quest rewards, only useful to build the Ion-Beam Accelerators from the [TFTD Gravships]() mod
[/list]

[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
The materials are both metallic and stony, so should be able to be used by any mod that works with those material types automatically

[h3]Known Issues[/h3]

[*]None yet !

[h2]The Point Of This Mod[/h2]
You can't have XCom ships without the colours of the hulls being correct and the Elerium and Zrbite just came after that

[h2]Future Plans[/h2]
[list]
[*]Patch some of the other XCom mods out there to use these materials to build them
[*]Add better ways to retrieve Elerium and Zrbite from somewhere, For now channel your inner XCom commander, download [Gravship Crashes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3578515873) and loot alien ships for parts !
