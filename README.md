This mod adds some materials from the games XCom: UFO Defense and XCom: Terror from the Deep, it's mainly to be used with my ship design mods linked below.

[h3]Features[/h3]
[list]
[*]Alien Alloys - Slightly worse than Plasteel, purple colour, can be "Smelted" at an Electric Smelter for the cost of 50 Stone Blocks to get 40 Alien Alloys (mimicing in the OG game how you can just build them)
[*]Aqua Plastics - Again slightly worse than Plasteel, but way better cold insulation and does good amount of blunt damage , can be "Smelted" at an Electric Smelter for the cost of 50 Stone Blocks to get 40 Aqua Plastics (mimicing in the OG game how you can just build them)
[*]Elerium-115 - Rare item that can be found from exotic traders or quest rewards, only useful to build the Sectoid Thrusters from the [XCom Gravships](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3577855868) mod
[*]Zrbite - Rare item that can be found from exotic traders or quest rewards, only useful to build the Ion-Beam Accelerators from the [TFTD Gravships]() mod
[/list]


[h3]Mod Compatibility[/h3]
In theory it should be compatible with everything, if you're using an exported mod from someone else then you will need any mods they decided to include on the ship otherwise the thing won't spawn and might throw an error.
